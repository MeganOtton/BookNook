## Project Outline
___

PROJECT TITLE is a fictional website/organisation dedicated to bringing awareness to mental health, with a primary focus of spotting the signs and symptoms of mental health struggles and what can be done to improve mental health.
The page developed as part of this project documents the website/organisation's resources, information whilst offering support and contact options for guidance.

#### Key Objectives
 - A clear and easy to navigate website,
 - Positive and uplifting messages to encourage users to seek help or read the resources,
 - Responsive design that works effectively on all web sizes,
 - Color and imagery that matches the theme of the website and is calming for the user,

## UX Design
___

### User Stories

- 

### Color Design

For this project I have mimicked a previous project I completed on a similar topic to help speed up time, I have chosen simple reds to mimic old fashioned ribbon bookmarks. I have used a wooden background to mimic the back of a library shelf with the actual shelves themselves having shelf images. The design of this webpage is to represent an actual library bookshelf but digitally.

#### Add Color Pallette Image

### Fonts

Fonts was another thing to consider when deciding this website, the emotions i convey to the user is really important. 

FONT CHOICE 1 was used for Logos, Headings and other elements that are of significance. It is a DESCRIPTIVE WORD (IE PLAYFUL, FUN, CALMING ETC)

FONT CHOICE 2 was used for Logos, Headings and other elements that are of significance. It is a DESCRIPTIVE WORD (IE PLAYFUL, FUN, CALMING ETC)

## Wireframes
___
These wireframes have been created using Balsamiq to define the key feature layout to guide the user experience design as well as blocking out the rough color pallete to identify any key issues. I will be utilising Bootstrap's framework to help blockout the website key elements.

## Imagery
___

The imagery is an important way to get infromation across to the users, with that in mind i came up with a specific criteria the images had to fulfill:

- Clear in the meaning of the image,
- Promote Inclusivity,
- Appropriate for the intended audience (16 and above),
- Avoid triggering or sensitive imagery or themes.

Due to the sensitive nature of the project and mental health in itself, i want to avoid any images that can be harmful to the user. The images and icons that are going to be used need to be calm and cheerful, with that in mind i will not be using any realistic imagery when it comes to mental health issues. I will be using more illustrated imagery to represent the issues to be more sensitive to the users.

## Features
___
#### General Features
In order to fulfil the criteria set out by the user stories, listed above, the page will consist of various sectioned information each with a variety of links, resources or other elements that contribute to the website fullfilling its goals and aiding the user.

Upon coding the projectand implementing the Bootstrap Framework the features and design shifted slightly from the original wireframe.
Some key adjustments are as follow:

## Responsive Design
___

I will be utilising the Bootstrap Framework allowed for an implementation that is responsive without the need for additional CSS or media queries, in most instances.

With some experimentation I have been able to create a page that is fully responsive to modern standards with the use of media queries.

Below is an image of my website from different devices.

## AI Implementation
___
#### Use Cases and Reflections:
#### - Code Creation
  - I used AI like copilot to help implement and generate elements from bootstrap without having to source it from bootstraps website. This sped up creation time exponentially in a project where time is limited.
  - I used it to generate code that i had not yet learned ie the Java Script element for the NavBar.

#### - Debugging 
  - I used Copilot to fix or change elements of my own code to make them more aligned with the websites vision. This was a useful time saving technique which if nto used could have taken hours of research to fix/edit manually.

#### - Overall Impact
  - AI tools streamlined repetive tasks and basic jobs, enabling me to focus on the more complex elements of the development. (Same goes for the Bootstrap elements)
